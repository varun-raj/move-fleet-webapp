### Tech stack

1. NextJS Pages Router
2. Better Auth for Authentication 
3. Drizzle for DB
4. TailwindCSS for Styling
5. ShadCN for components. 


### New Design component

1. Use only ShadCN components under `components/ui`
2. Use Tailwind Colors and Add both dark and light theme colors
3. Do not use Radix components directly.


### Typescript 

1. Never use async await, always use promise chaining
2. Use NextJS's Page Router for routing and structure.

### Data Fetching and submission

1. Use @tanstack/react-query package for data fetching 
  - When there is a long list use infinite query 
2. The form data for submission should be stored in `formData` state and used upon submission.
3. Form should have `submitting` flag to show the submission loader and disable the submit button when the flag is true.
